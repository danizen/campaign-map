## Summary

A campaign map to look at between sessions

## Usage

Generate a map image:

 * Should be square
 * Pixel size should be a power of 2

Run `./gentiles.py` to generate tiles from the image.  The command has usage, and I stole it and made it work with Python 3.

Run `npm install` to install front-end dependencies.

Run `npm run build` to build application.
